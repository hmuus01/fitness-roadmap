1on1 Fitness Marketplace: 10-Week Launch Roadmap

This repository hosts an interactive single-page application (SPA) detailing the 10-week business and development roadmap for the 1on1 Fitness Marketplace project.

🚀 How to View

Since this is a single, self-contained HTML file, you can view the live application easily:

Directly via GitHub Pages: If hosted on GitHub Pages, the application will be available at your public URL (e.g., https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/).

Locally: Download the index.html file and open it directly in any web browser.

📋 Roadmap Structure

The plan is divided into four main phases:

Phase 1: Foundations (Core technical setup and user profiles)

Phase 2: Supply (Venue and coach listing/availability tools)

Phase 3: Demand (Search, booking, and payment integration)

Phase 4: Launch (Retention features, monitoring, and final deployment)

The interactive dashboard allows you to track progress against key milestones and visualize the project's timeline and complexity.
